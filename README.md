# Installation

This template folder needs to be installed into a dokuwiki folder. To setup a local dokuwiki instance, it is recommended to follow the [installation instructions](https://www.dokuwiki.org/installer) of DokuWiki in a LAMP/MAMP/WAMP environment.

For Mac development, install [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) Free version, and then clone this repo/folder into `lib/tpl/bootstrap3/` of your MAMP web folder. The package is configured to be named `bootstrap3` so keep the folder name as is until we figure out how to customize it. :-)

Please refer to https://www.dokuwiki.org/template for additional info on how to install templates in DokuWiki.

# Deployment

Admins on the Digital Ocean server will be able to pull the latest updates from the Git repo.
